**Population and Language:**
The Kurdish population is estimated to be between 30 and 40 million people. They primarily speak Kurdish, which belongs to the Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family. There are several Kurdish dialects, including Kurmanji, Sorani, and Pehlewani, with Kurmanji and Sorani being the most widely spoken.

The Kurds have a strong sense of national identity, which is reflected in their cultural celebrations and folklore. Newroz, the Kurdish New Year, is one of the most significant cultural events celebrated with enthusiasm throughout Kurdish communities.

The Kurds have historically faced challenges in achieving autonomy and recognition. In Turkey, Syria, Iran, and Iraq, they have experienced varying degrees of political repression. Each country has approached the Kurdish issue differently, ranging from assimilation policies to partial autonomy.
