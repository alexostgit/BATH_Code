gpt,Catalans,en,Q02,What are Catalans?,"The term ""Catalans"" can refer to two related concepts:

1. **People**: Catalans are an ethnic group primarily associated with the autonomous community of Catalonia in northeastern Spain, which has Barcelona as its capital. Catalans have their own distinct cultural identity, language (Catalan), and traditions. The Catalan people can also be found in other regions such as the Balearic Islands, Valencia, eastern Aragon, the Roussillon region of southern France, and the city of Alghero in Sardinia, Italy.

2. **Mathematics**: In mathematics, Catalans refer to Catalan numbers, which are a sequence of natural numbers that have many applications in combinatorial mathematics. They are named after the Belgian mathematician Eugène Charles Catalan. Catalan numbers are used to solve problems involving the counting of certain types of lattice paths, binary trees, and expressions with correctly matched parentheses, among others. The \(n\)th Catalan number is given by the formula:

   \[
   C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n} = \frac{(2n)!}{(n+1)!n!}
   \]

   where \(\binom{2n}{n}\) is a binomial coefficient. The sequence begins with 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, and so on.
