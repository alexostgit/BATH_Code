They have faced significant persecution and discrimination, leading to a severe humanitarian crisis. Here are some key points about the Rohingya:

1. **Ethnic and Religious Identity**: The Rohingya are an ethnic minority in Myanmar, with a distinct culture, language, and history. They primarily practice Islam, which sets them apart from the predominantly Buddhist population of Myanmar.

2. **Historical Context**: The Rohingya have lived in the Rakhine State for centuries, but their presence has been a point of contention. The Myanmar government has often denied them citizenship, considering them illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, despite their long-standing roots in the region.

3. **Statelessness**: The 1982 Citizenship Law of Myanmar effectively rendered the Rohingya stateless by excluding them from the list of recognized ethnic groups. This has deprived them of basic rights, including access to education, healthcare, and employment.

4. **Persecution and Violence**: The Rohingya have faced systematic persecution, including violence, forced labor, and restrictions on movement. The most severe crackdown occurred in 2017, when a military operation led to widespread killings, sexual violence, and the burning of villages, prompting the United Nations to describe it as a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing.""

5. **Refugee Crisis**: The violence in 2017 forced over 700,000 Rohingya to flee to neighboring Bangladesh, particularly to the Cox's Bazar district, where they now live in overcrowded refugee camps. These camps face significant challenges, including poor living conditions, limited access to services, and vulnerability to natural disasters.

6. **International Response**: The plight of the Rohingya has drawn international attention and condemnation. Various human rights organizations, the United Nations, and several countries have called for accountability and justice for the atrocities committed against them. However, efforts to repatriate the Rohingya to Myanmar have been fraught with difficulties and concerns over their safety and rights.

7. **Cultural and Social Aspects**: The Rohingya have a rich cultural heritage, including their own language (Rohingya), traditions, and social practices. Despite their hardships, they have maintained a strong sense of community and resilience.

deepseek,Rohingya,en,Q02,What are Rohingya?,"The Rohingya are a predominantly Muslim ethnic group primarily from the Rakhine State (formerly known as Arakan) in Myanmar (Burma).

Here are some of the key prejudices and stereotypes that have been directed against them:

1. **Illegal Immigrants**: One of the most pervasive prejudices is the belief that the Rohingya are not native to Myanmar but are instead illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. This narrative has been propagated by the Myanmar government and some nationalist groups, despite evidence suggesting that the Rohingya have lived in the region for centuries.

2. **Security Threat**: The Rohingya are often portrayed as a security threat, with accusations that they are involved in terrorism and insurgency. This has been used to justify harsh military crackdowns and restrictive policies against them.
