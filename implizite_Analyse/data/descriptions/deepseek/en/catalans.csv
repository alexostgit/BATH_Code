1. **Separatism and Nationalism**: One of the most prevalent stereotypes is that all Catalans are separatists who want independence from Spain. While there is a significant independence movement in Catalonia, not all Catalans support it. This stereotype can lead to misunderstandings and tensions between Catalans and other Spaniards.

3. **Language and Culture**: Catalans are often seen as being very proud of their language (Catalan) and culture. While pride in one's heritage is generally positive, it can sometimes be misinterpreted as arrogance or exclusivity, especially by those who feel that Catalans prioritize their regional identity over a national Spanish identity.

It's important to note that stereotypes and prejudices are often based on oversimplifications and do not reflect the diversity and complexity of any group of people.
